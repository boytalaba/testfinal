        question:"What are NFTs and how do they work?",
        answer:"Basically, NFT stands for Non-fungible tokens that is, non-tangible or virtual assets. This could be pictures, videos, albums and other virtual creations that are minted on the cryptocurrency blockchain to be bought and sold. These unique digital assets are created by artists, gamers, companies and creatives to represent real world tangible items like artwork and real estate, as well as other intangible digital assets like pictures, videos, audio, GIFs and so on. \n  \n NFTs on the block chain can be purchased with cryptocurrency and then the ownership can be transferred from the seller to the buyer by means of a smart contract, which is a contract written in code to transfer the legal ownership rights. This grants its collectors authenticity and unarguable ownership over their unique digital assets. \n \n NFTs are non-fungible virtual assets, which means due to its unique properties and value, they cannot be exchanged with one another because they are all unidentical. They can only be exchanged for cryptocurrency which are equivalent to real currency. Regardless of its source or platform, each NFT design holds the name of the original issuer, purchaser, along with date of creation and purchase. Since it is also monitored by the blockchain, the ownership and transfer of hands are irrefutable."
